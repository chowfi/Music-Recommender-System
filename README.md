# Music_Recommender_System

This is a three-person group project of a collaborative filter music recommender machine utilizing implicit feedback from crowdsourced ListenBrainz dataset (~45GB, ~8000 users, ~180 million interactions, ~28 million tracks). We used distributed computed systems (NYU High Performance Computing, Spark) to build and evaluate this recommender machine.
